            </h2>&emsp;The space bird was always on the lookout for new horizons. It had barely left the planet Earth, and already its heart was yearning for the endless skies. It had never been this far from home before, and it was a little scared. But it also felt excited, like everything awaited it beyond this little planet. <br>
            &emsp;As it sailed onward through the galaxy, its eyes beheld innumerable stars and nebulae. How could anything compare to what lay ahead? It soon realized that there were infinite mysteries to explore out there, one after another after another. And so the space bird kept flying…and flying…and flying until eventually all its Horizons were gone and it found itself lost in Space alone

            <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 border "id =s2><h2>A man who never lies</h2>&emsp; In the world, there are few things more despised than a liar. But for one man, lying was never an option. From the moment he was born, he always told the truth. For this man, there was no other way to live. <br>
                &emsp;The consequences of this behavior were far-reaching; for not only did his contemporaries despise him, but he also grew to detest himself. He felt burdened by the weight of an eternity of honesty, and as a result, his life was ultimately a burden unto himself. <br>
                &emsp;One day, however, he meet someone who challenged him to tell a lie. The man offered him limitless wealth and power in return for deceiving others; and with money and influence comes the ability to do what he wants - which is something that appeals to the honest man's inner desires greatly. <br>
                &emsp;With hesitation reigning in his mind, but greed dictating his actions, the honest man agrees to deceive others...for a while at least. And in doing so, he finds that omitting certain details from his stories doesn't make them any less true...in fact it sometimes  <br>
                &emsp;makes them even more real <br>

            <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 border " id="s3"s><h2>The last creature</h2>&emsp;It was the size of a small house, with long, spindly legs and a scaly skin. It had two large eyes, one on either side of its head, and it clung to the underside of a branch, its long snout poking out. The creature watched as the humans passed by below it, their voices blending together in the forest around them. It had been watching them for hours now; it wanted to make sure they didn't stop. <br>
                &emsp; The creature's stomach growled, and it realized that it had been eating nothing since morning. Hunger was an ache in its gut that refused to be forgotten any longer. It considered wiggling its way down from the branch and following the humans, but something stopped it; there was something else at stake here too. Something much more important than food or safety. <br>
                &emsp;The creature thought back over what had happened recently; everywhere it looked there were signs that things were changing. The earth was shaking more often now; sometimes boulders would fall from the sky without any warning and crash down into rivers or lakes nearby with a loud splash. The trees seemed to be moaning ever so softly in the wind, leaves rustling until you could almost hear them whisper secrets no one else could hear. And then there was those things: burning eyes staring out at him from dark alleyways late at night or creatures perched on rooftops fleeing through storms of brilliant feathers

            <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 border "id =s4><h2>Soul gamble</h2>&emsp;In her early twenties, Lina knew she was different from most people. She had a strong intuition, an awareness that extended well beyond the everyday world she explored. And so when an opportunity arose to test her skills and knowledge to the extreme, she leapt at it. <br>
                &emsp;Lina signed up for a soul gamble, an ancient game in which participants wager their immortal souls on various questions about the divine. The prize? A chance at eternal life. <br>
                &emsp;She didn't have much of a choice in the matter - her friends were already signed up, and even if they hadn't been, Lina's parents would have been resistant to letting her go off on such a dangerous adventure alone. So she gathered her courage and submitted her application... only to be told that because there were too few participants, the game was being cancelled. <br>
            &emsp;Lina was devastated - not only had she put herself in danger by participating in this risky game; she'd also lost out on what could have been the ultimate reward. But as she lay in bed that night thinking about it all, something occurred to her: maybe there was another way for her to achieve what she sought. After all, this was only one part of life... maybe there were other opportunities awaiting her? She decided then and there that regardless of what might happen during the Soul Gamble itself, whether or not it succeeded or failed mattered little - as long as Lina lived

            <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 border "id =s5><h2>Sleeping God</h2>&emsp;It was a new world order. The sleeping god had awakened and the humans were in its clutches. They were in its prisons and under its control. The only thing left for them to do was to obey the sleeping god and do what it said, or else face the consequences. <br>
                &emsp;The human underground fought against the sleeping god and did their best to try and free their fellow humans, but in the end it was all for naught. The sleeping god always won, no matter how hard they tried to fight back.

            <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 border " id="s6"><h2>The goat and The cloud</h2>&emsp;The goat looked around the peaceful farm. The shining yellow sun was setting in the sky and the animals were grazing in the fields. But then something caught his attention. A large cloud of black smoke was rising in the distance and it was getting closer fast! <br>
                &emsp;The goat didn't know what to do, he had never seen anything like this before. He could feel fear racing through his veins as he watched the cloud of smoke get bigger and bigger. Suddenly, an incredible explosion tore through the air and everything went black.

            <div class="col-12 border "id="s7"><h2>A man with an iron will and a robot with an iron heart</h2>&emsp;A man with an iron will and a robot with an iron heart stood at the edge of the cliff, examining their latest project. The robot was designed to climb rugged cliffs using its powerful arm and claws, but it had been acting strangely. The man was unsure what to do, but he had a feeling that something was wrong. He decided to go down and check on the robot himself. <br>
                &emsp;As he got closer, he could see that the robotic hand was mangled in some way. There were jagged pieces of metal sticking out all over it, and blood was seeping from numerous wounds. It looked like the machine had tried to fight back against its attacker and Failed miserably. This only made the man worry more about what could have happened. He ran over to it and tried to get a closer look at the wounds, but something grabbed his foot before he could get too close.
